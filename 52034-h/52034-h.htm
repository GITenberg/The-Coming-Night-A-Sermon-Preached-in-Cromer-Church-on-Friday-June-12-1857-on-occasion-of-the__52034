class="smcap">John ix</span>. 4.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is
day: the night cometh, when no man can work.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> week has been one of heavy
sorrow to very many.&nbsp; The neighbourhood has lost one who for
many years has stood foremost in large-hearted Christian
benevolence.&nbsp; The poor have been deprived of a kind friend,
to whose liberality they might ever resort.&nbsp; The children
have been bereaved of one who has for years been anxious to
devote her attentive care to their early training; and all who
have ever needed a sympathizing friend have followed one this day
to the grave as warm-hearted, energetic, and intelligent as is
often to be met with in society.&nbsp; Her character is well
described in some lines written by herself on the death of one
she dearly loved&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Within this frame, by Jesu&rsquo;s
grace,<br />
High gifts and holy held their place;<br />
A noble heart, a mighty mind,<br />
Were here in bonds of clay confined.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>And all
this is now gone.&nbsp; The spirit has taken its flight.&nbsp;
Northrepps Cottage is without its tenant.&nbsp; The ruins of the
body have been left this morning in the ruins of the little
church, and many a weeping heart has sent forth its unmistakable
evidence of genuine and deep-felt sorrow.</p>
<p>But we may be quite certain that there is a wise unseen
purpose in this bereavement.&nbsp; Not a sparrow falls to the
ground without the Father&rsquo;s knowledge, and how much more
may we be satisfied that &ldquo;precious in the sight of the Lord
is the death of his saints.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are many of his
dispensations which seem very dark to short-sighted men, but they
all have their sure purpose.&nbsp; Many and bitter were the tears
shed at Bethany when Lazarus died; painful and anxious the
watchings of his affectionate sisters as they saw their dear
brother growing worse and worse, till all hope ceased, and the
struggle ended in his death.&nbsp; Yet all was for a gracious
purpose; as the Lord Himself said, &ldquo;This sickness is not
unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might
be glorified thereby.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many, doubtless, were the
tears shed by the parents of the blind man whose case is
described in our chapter.&nbsp; Many a heartache must they both
have felt as they saw their dear boy in the midst of his
companions, but unable through his <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>blindness to share their games or
enjoy their pleasures; but there was a kind purpose in that
lengthened trial, for as we read in verse 3, it was permitted
&ldquo;that the works of God should be made manifest in
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, doubtless, there is a sacred purpose in
this present affliction.&nbsp; It may be hidden from you, but it
is not hidden from Him who has appointed it.&nbsp; Be sure, all
ye mourners, that your tears are not for nought.&nbsp; There is a
needs be for the whole.&nbsp; Not a sorrow has ever yet been laid
on any one of God&rsquo;s people from the very first, nor ever
will be laid on them to the end of time, without some clear, some
gracious, some wise purpose on the part of our God.&nbsp; Let us,
then, endeavour in the sorrow for her death to learn the lessons
taught us by the retrospect of her life; and, instead of simply
deploring our loss, let us strive to move a step forward in our
own upward progress.</p>
<p>Now, in looking at her character, the point that strikes my
own mind more than any other is the fine, vigorous, persevering,
affectionate, and unselfish use of time and talents; and in
studying this we cannot do better than take as our guide the
words of our blessed Lord, &ldquo;I must work the works of him
that sent me while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can
work.&rdquo;&nbsp; May the Holy Spirit bless the study of the
passage to the salvation of souls and the glory of Christ!</p>
<h3><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>I.&nbsp;
<i>The day</i>.</h3>
<p>The idea is to compare life to the daytime, and the comparison
is one as appropriate as it is simple.</p>
<p>The day is the time for intercourse; the time when, in the
light of heaven, we enjoy each other&rsquo;s fellowship, and have
all the lovely scenery of God&rsquo;s creation brought to the
view: and so it is with life.&nbsp; It is the short and sacred
season in which we are placed together in the flesh, surrounded
by those we love, linked together by countless ties, refreshed
and cheered by happy intercourse.&nbsp; In the daytime of life
there ought to be the enjoyment of each other&rsquo;s love, and
the mutual fellowship with each other&rsquo;s interests.&nbsp;
And where, I may safely inquire, could be found a welcome more
hearty, or a greeting more affectionate, than in Northrepps
Cottage?&nbsp; How many are there in this church that have
experienced the warm cordiality of that hearty welcome that was
to be found there on every occasion!&nbsp; She might have been
busy or at leisure, at ease or in severe suffering; but it made
no difference in the real genuine pleasure with which she
received you under her roof.</p>
<p>But the prominent point of the text is, that the day is the
time for work; the brief period set apart for labour; the chosen
opportunity, the short time in which it is our sacred privilege
to be doing something <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>for God and man&mdash;something to
bring man nearer to God, and something to bring down God&rsquo;s
blessing in larger abundance upon man.&nbsp; Thus our various
positions in life correspond with the various periods of the
day.&nbsp; There is the little child, with its mind just opening
and intelligence just dawning, like the sun rising in the
east.&nbsp; There is the young man, entering life full of energy,
hope, and power, with all his work before him, corresponding to
the morning period, when the risen sun is summoning mankind to
labour.&nbsp; There is the middle-aged man, with the advantage of
half a life&rsquo;s experience, and scarcely yet feeling the
symptoms of decay, like the sun at its height in the fulness of
his meridian splendour.&nbsp; And there is the aged Christian,
with the grey hairs coming on upon his head, with his strength
diminishing, but wisdom deepening and hope brightening, with the
greater part of life already past, and an earnest desire that the
short remainder should be well occupied for
God,&mdash;corresponding to the gradual closing in of
evening.&nbsp; And then, at last, there is the bright conclusion,
when the soul is lighted up at the immediate prospect of his
Lord&rsquo;s presence; when rest is taking the place of labour,
and triumph that of conflict; so that there is all the beauty of
a glorious Christian sunset.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;And when he comes nearer to finish his race,<br />
Like a fine setting sun he looks richer in grace,<br />
And gives a new hope at the end of his days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of rising in
brighter array.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>II.&nbsp; <i>The night</i>.</h3>
<p>Our Lord says, &ldquo;The night cometh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, there is something inexpressibly solemn in such a thought
to the unconverted and unprepared; for the night, in such a case,
is the deep, dark, cheerless night, that settles down on the
wicked; a night of black darkness, and without one ray of light
or hope; a night in which there is not even one star visible, nor
the least encouragement from the most distant hope of
morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;To what end,&rdquo; saith the Prophet,
&ldquo;is the day of the Lord to you?&nbsp; The day of the Lord
is darkness and not light.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh! that every
unconverted man would consider well what is his own prospect when
his sun sets, and would make haste in seeking that blessed Lord
who can turn darkness into light, and death into immortality and
life!</p>
<p>But how different is the night to the believer,&mdash;to such
an one as we are now called to mourn!&nbsp; When the evening was
closing in, and the sun just setting, she was not aware of her
great danger, and still thought she had strength to recover; but
when a dear friend thought it her duty to inform her that <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the time of
separation was very nearly come, her reply was that of calm faith
and full submission,&mdash;&ldquo;Let us then obediently receive
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The truth was realized, and accepted at the hand
of God.&nbsp; There is no real night in such a case; or, if there
be, it is like the night in the Arctic summer, in which the sun
is always visible; for such are never separate from Him who is
both light and life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sun of my soul, thou Saviour dear,<br />
It is not night if thou art near.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or it is like the night in the height of summer, when the
twilight of evening waits to welcome the dawn of morning, and it
is almost difficult to discover whether it is the past sunset or
the coming sunrise that sheds a soft brightness over the
heavens.&nbsp; So, throughout the believer&rsquo;s night-time,
there is continuous light till the morning dawns.&nbsp; And then
what a morning will it be!&nbsp; The morning of resurrection, the
morning of righteousness, the morning of joy, the morning of the
Redeemer&rsquo;s triumph!&nbsp; &ldquo;Sorrow may endure for a
night, but joy cometh in the morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every tear
will then be dry; every anxious soul will then be satisfied;
every aching heart will then be healed, and every care forgotten
in the sweet peace of uninterrupted union with Christ.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Such is
the night of the believer; and therefore it appears only to
deserve the name of night because it is the close of this
world&rsquo;s working season.&nbsp; Angels, not men, do the work
of heaven; and they are sent forth to minister to them that shall
be heirs of salvation.&nbsp; But to the believer, the
characteristic of the heavenly state is rest.&nbsp; The interval
between death and the resurrection is a period of holy, happy,
peaceful, intelligent rest.&nbsp; &ldquo;They rest from their
labours, and their works do follow them.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the
late lamented Bishop Weeks was entering on his most laborious
mission at Lambeth, and when it was remarked to him that he would
have hard work to carry out his plans, his reply
was,&mdash;&ldquo;But there will be plenty of rest at the
end.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is well to dwell on that blessed hope of
rest; it is well, when the heart grows weary, to know that there
is repose in prospect.&nbsp; That, however, is not the great
lesson to be learned, but rather this.&nbsp; If that be the time
for rest, then this is the day for work; and we must all make
haste to seize the opportunity in its rapid flight.&nbsp; I
remember to have seen a card in the study of a friend, on which
it was written, &ldquo;Lost between the hours of sunrise and
sunset a golden hour, set in sixty diamond minutes.&nbsp; No
reward is offered for their recovery, for they are lost for
ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh, <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>let not the precious time which God
has given us be lost, but rather at the close of each day let us
each one put the question, and put it honestly&mdash;What has
been done this day for God?&nbsp; I had the great privilege of
visiting the late Mrs. Fry in her dying illness, and she then
said to me, &ldquo;I believe I can safely say that, since the
time of my conversion, my first thought on awaking has been, what
can I do this day for God?&rdquo;&nbsp; Would that all of us
lived in such a spirit, with a more constant thoughtfulness for
our Master&rsquo;s service!&nbsp; For is it possible to imagine
anything more deeply affecting, than to see a man at the close of
life with no effort made for Him who has redeemed him by his
blood?&nbsp; There he is with his race nearly run, and his
opportunity almost over.&nbsp; He has passed through life with
time and talents; with friends, servants, children, under his
influence, and now what has he done?&nbsp; He may have made his
fortune, acquired a reputation, and filled his home with
comforts; he may have done well for himself, and perhaps done
well for his family; but for his God, for his blessed Lord who
has done all for him, who has shed his own most precious blood
that his sins might be blotted out&mdash;for Him he has done
nothing.&nbsp; His day is almost <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>over, and he has spent it for
himself; his life is nearly run out, and he has lived it for
himself.&nbsp; And now he is about to lie down and die; but still
all in himself, with his hope in himself, his strength in
himself; and that hope all vanity, that strength all
weakness.</p>
<p>How different is the end of him, who when his sun sets is
found well at work for God!&nbsp; Who can look back on the whole
pilgrimage, and though he discovers countless defects, and is
compelled to come before God with the prayer, &ldquo;Pardon the
iniquity of my holy things;&rdquo; is yet found in his
harness&mdash;not rusting out, but working out, with the loins
girt, and the lamp burning, and the whole man conscientiously
consecrated to God!</p>
<p>Now, such was truly the case with our departed friend.&nbsp;
Her eye was not dim, nor her hand heavy even to the last.&nbsp;
Even after the fatal illness had set in upon her, she assembled
the teachers and school-children of the place where she was
sojourning; and as disease advanced, she said with characteristic
energy to her faithful attendant, &ldquo;If I go home I must do
more for God, and you must keep me up to it.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
there was no return in prospect; her work was finished, and she
has entered on her rest.</p>
<h3><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>III.&nbsp; <i>The work</i>.</h3>
<p>Now, the text teaches us at the outset, that the work to which
our Lord referred was an appointed work.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must work
the works of him that sent me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was sent to carry
out God&rsquo;s purpose, and intrusted with an apostleship from
the Father, to which apostleship he here refers.&nbsp; In the
same sense, every individual has his apostleship or
mission.&nbsp; The trust may vary, and no two men have the same
mission.&nbsp; One has money committed to him, one time, one
stores of knowledge; another family ties, and another
widely-extended influence; but all have their work from
God.&nbsp; The master, the servant, the rich, the poor, the
preacher, the hearer, the clergyman, the layman, the father, the
child&mdash;all have their mission; and it is the part of the
wise Christian to endeavour to see clearly what that mission is,
and then to lay himself out for the work to which God has called
and fitted him.</p>
<p>Now, I think that all who knew our dear departed friend must
acknowledge that this was pre-eminently the case with her.&nbsp;
She was one who had her mission, and endeavoured most faithfully
to fulfil it.&nbsp; She was intrusted with property, and you all
know what use she made of it.&nbsp; She <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>did not keep
it as if it were her own, but employed it, as knowing that it was
her Lord&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>She was intrusted with time and fine talents, and we all know
how she used them.</p>
<p>Remember her interest in foreign objects.&nbsp; How great was
her zeal for missionary work!&nbsp; Even in her dying hours, she
left her charge that 50<i>l.</i> be given to the Mandingo
Mission, a Mission scarcely known in the Church, but which had
been brought to her notice by a friend.&nbsp; How steady and
stimulating was her attachment to the Bible Society! and how did
her heart yearn to the very last over the wrongs and woes of
Africa!&nbsp; Never yet was there a more zealous and intelligent
supporter of the great foreign enterprises of the Church of
Christ.</p>
<p>But some persons are disposed to say, Why always think of
Africa, and foreign lands?&nbsp; Why not turn your attention more
to home?&nbsp; In answer to which inquiry, I would simply say,
that I believe it to be capable of the most indisputable proof
that, as a general rule, the best friends of Africa are the best
philanthropists at home.&nbsp; The fact is, that Christian love
is expansive in its character, and cannot be chained down to one
locality.&nbsp; And of this we have just parted with a noble
proof.&nbsp; She <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>was zealous for Africa, but there was no neglect of her
own neighbourhood.&nbsp; Let the fishermen all along the coast
bear their testimony, and it must be to her zeal and energy for
their good.&nbsp; Let the lads who used to meet on Sunday
afternoons for instruction bear their witness to the reality of
her Christian perseverance.&nbsp; Let the young women of the
village, and the school children that were privileged to meet for
instruction every morning at the cottage, let them give their
evidence, and it must be to the most steady and affectionate
perseverance for their welfare.&nbsp; Oh! that these lessons may
be now remembered!&nbsp; Oh! that the voice may be listened to
from the grave, and that the seed so carefully sown may be found
to spring up to present holiness and future blessedness in Christ
Jesus!&nbsp; Nor was this limited to purely religious
effort.&nbsp; Look back upon her deep interest in all that befell
the shipping.&nbsp; Remember her energy with reference to her
gun.&nbsp; Recall her energetic figure seated on the cliff in the
midst of the storm, to stimulate the efforts of those who were
endeavouring to save the shipwrecked sailors.&nbsp; Recall all
this, and remember that it was done in the midst of physical
infirmity and pain, that might well have justified an indulgent
consideration of self.&nbsp; If any one might have claimed
exemption from active effort it was she.&nbsp; If any <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>one might
have pleaded disability it was she; and her conduct is a noble
evidence of the power of the heart to overcome the body, and a
splendid proof that faith and zeal never recognize impediments,
except as fresh incentives to energetic activity for God.</p>
<p>And now, brethren, all this activity is over.&nbsp; She rests
from her labours, and her works do follow her.&nbsp; But there is
a great void left in this neighbourhood.&nbsp; A gap is made and
the responsibility of filling it is thrown on the
survivors.&nbsp; It is well, therefore, for us all to remember
that our own night-time is rapidly advancing.&nbsp; On how many
well known to those here present has it already closed!&nbsp; How
many workmen for God are already in their rest!&nbsp; Let your
mind look back to one of the Meetings of the Bible or Church
Missionary Society some fifteen or twenty years ago.&nbsp; On how
large a proportion of those who were then the active labourers
has the night already closed!&nbsp; There you might have heard
that manly and energetic labourer for God, Sir Fowell Buxton, in
full vigour pleading for God and men, but his night is come: and
my own dear father by his side, full of sterling, high
principled, Christian zeal; but his night too is come: and the
faithful pastor of the little flock at Gresham, always ready to
take a part on such occasions, but his night is <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>come: and our
zealous friend from Sherringham, who rejoiced to co-operate in
every such enterprise, but her night is come: and the two Cottage
Ladies united in the strong bond of sisterly affection, and
acting together with a sacred unanimity for God, but now their
suns have both set, they now rest as they once lived, together,
and the night has closed in on almost the whole of that noble
company.&nbsp; But there were present likewise young men, just
rising into life, and just beginning to put forth their powers;
and time has now done its work with them.&nbsp; Some, indeed, it
has cut down, so that their sun has set even at noon; but for the
most part it has had the effect of placing them where their
fathers then stood.&nbsp; Their own brows are becoming furrowed,
and their own hairs grey.&nbsp; They have already reached the
afternoon of life.&nbsp; The shades even of evening are beginning
to appear among those who were then lads and listeners.&nbsp; And
now that they have been this day called to follow to the grave
almost the last of a whole generation of faithful labourers
passed away, the lesson spoken to them from the tomb is surely
that conveyed in the text, &ldquo;I must work the works of Him
that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in speaking of this sacred work we must not <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>lose sight of
the paramount importance of a personal work in our own
soul.&nbsp; It would be, indeed, an awful thing to be compelled
to acknowledge, &ldquo;They made me the keeper of the vineyards,
and mine own vineyard have I not kept;&rdquo; to preach to
others, and yet oneself to be a cast away; to work as a
philanthropist, and perish as an unconverted man.&nbsp; We should
take, therefore, a most imperfect view of the subject, if we were
to neglect the consideration of the personal work within.</p>
<p>And this we ought to carry through all departments, for God
has given to each man certain powers, and these should be
improved.&nbsp; We are not at liberty to leave neglected the high
gifts which God has given us.&nbsp; The intellect which God has
bestowed should not lie dormant.&nbsp; And I cannot but think
that we have parted with a noble example in this respect.&nbsp;
How vigorous was her spirit of self-improvement!&nbsp; How
stimulating was her influence on all who came within her
reach!&nbsp; How urgent she was with young men that they should
aim high, and not sit at ease satisfied with inferiority! and
what a fine example did she herself set them!&nbsp; What a
contrast did she present to the listless, fanciful, and indolent
novel reader upon the sofa!&nbsp; How manfully did she grapple
with one language one after another!&nbsp; I cannot enumerate <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>those that
she had acquired, but this we all know that she qualified herself
to become the valued correspondent of the first linguists of the
day; and now, if, beside her grave, we could have breathed a wish
of such a kind, it would have been that she could have left us,
as a legacy, some small fraction of the rich stores of her
accumulated knowledge!</p>
<p>But it is not merely an intellectual work that has to be
considered, for, after all, what are all intellectual
acquirements if we be not in Christ?&nbsp; Nay! we may extend the
question further and inquire, what would all our labour in such a
case avail us before God?&nbsp; And if we be not forgiven in
Christ Jesus how shall any one of us stand in his presence?&nbsp;
Can intellect justify?&nbsp; Can talent justify?&nbsp; Can
self-improvement justify?&nbsp; Nay, more, can philanthropic
effort justify?&nbsp; Can benevolence justify?&nbsp; Can
religious activity justify?&nbsp; Can energetic labour for God
justify?&nbsp; Beautiful, indeed, are all such things when
springing forth as the rich fruits of heavenly grace in the soul
of the justified believer; but nothing better than filthy rags if
employed as a covering for the dark moral guilt in the soul of
the sinner.&nbsp; No, brethren!&nbsp; If the inquiry is made, how
must the soul be saved?&nbsp; How can the sin be blotted
out?&nbsp; How can the sinner stand justified in the Lord&rsquo;s
presence? <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>there is but one answer, and that is, <i>it must be in
Christ</i>.&nbsp; No intellect and no activity will ever lift us
above the old promise, &ldquo;Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,
and thou shalt be saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; All our hope is in the
substitution of the sinless Saviour for the sin-stricken sinner,
in the transfer of guilt from the guilty criminal to the
guiltless substitute; and if a man be a stranger to Christ,
though he have all the philanthropy of a Howard, or all the
intellect of a Newton, he will be found condemned before God for
the inherent corruption of his heart and character.&nbsp; Well,
therefore, does the Apostle urge us to &ldquo;Work out our own
salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in
us to will and to do of his good pleasure;&rdquo; and most
earnestly will every wise man pay good heed to the inquiry, Am I
in Christ Jesus?&nbsp; Am I born again of the Spirit?&nbsp; Is my
name written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life?&nbsp; Am I now
pardoned through His blood?&nbsp; Am I justified through His
righteousness?&nbsp; And am I prepared to meet Him in His
kingdom?</p>
<p>Now this hope was the turning point in the character of our
departed friend.&nbsp; After she had been informed that her end
was close at hand, her faithful attendants began to read to her
some of the promises of the Gospel, in the hope of assisting her
faith through her last struggle.&nbsp; But she preferred <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>silence, and
replied, &ldquo;I have them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who can wish more for
his dying hour than to be able to say, &ldquo;I have
them&rdquo;?&nbsp; For the words imply not merely that she had
them in her memory, but that she had them to reveal Christ to her
soul, and so to bear her up through her last struggle.&nbsp;
Happy that soul who is so possessed of the promises that he has
Christ as his glorious hope in his dying hour!</p>
<p>And now, dear brethren, to conclude.&nbsp; I am speaking to
some of you at the very outset of your career.&nbsp; Your sun is
only now rising in the fulness of its morning beauty.&nbsp; You
have, possibly, the greater part of life before you, some forty,
fifty, sixty years to be spent either for the world or for
God.&nbsp; Oh! dear brethren, let the whole of that vigour be
consecrated to Him.&nbsp; Leave it not to old age, then to hand
over the refuse of your powers.&nbsp; But now, in your youth and
in your vigour, remember the call of Him that has redeemed you by
His blood, and let the prime of your life be a freewill offering
to your Lord.&nbsp; Or possibly I am speaking to some old men who
have but a little time left; honoured fathers in the family of
God; men whose sun is sinking brightly, but still rapidly, in the
west.&nbsp; And what shall we say to such?&nbsp; Oh! dear
brethren, we would speak with the utmost respect and reverence,
but, bear with us <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>while we remind you that it is but a little time that
remains; but a very few more winters and then the sense of
loneliness will pass away in the society of heaven, and the pang
of the wounded heart will be for ever healed by the leaves of the
tree that we know are for the healing of the nations.&nbsp; Hold
on your way, then, for that little time with a good
courage.&nbsp; Let a bright hope sustain the failing eye, and the
Lord&rsquo;s right hand give vigour to the faltering step.&nbsp;
The rest is at hand; the privilege of labour is nearly over; let
no time, then, be lost in the service of our God, but, if the
power be less, let the zeal be greater than ever in the holy
efforts to be faithful servants to your Lord.</p>
<p>But why do we speak of different ages as if they secure to us
different periods of labour, for who can say how short his time
is?&nbsp; There may be many here who may never hear another
sermon, as I myself may never preach one.&nbsp; You may single
out the powerful young man with his broad chest, and open
forehead, and powerful arm, who may think himself safe for many
years to come, but who can say that ere a week closes, there
shall not be another funeral procession, and that young man,
notwithstanding all his strength, be borne by his sorrowing
friends to an unlooked-for grave?&nbsp; You may note some
middle-aged man in the full vigour <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>of midday life, who now thinks only
how he may maintain his wife and family; but let him remember
that ere another Sabbath dawns, that wife may be a widow and
those children fatherless.&nbsp; Oh, dear brethren, remember, I
beseech you, how short your time may be, and take heed that when
the day closes, you may be found in Christ!&nbsp; The door is
open to you now.&nbsp; The invitation is open to you now.&nbsp;
The promises of the Spirit are presented to you now.&nbsp; All
the rich gifts of the kingdom are offered now without money and
without price.&nbsp; Nay, more than that, you are now invited,
urged, entreated to accept them.&nbsp; But the night may come and
the door be shut to-morrow.&nbsp; Hearken, then, I beseech you,
ye that are still unconverted sinners, ye that are still without
Christ.&nbsp; Hearken, ye that are still strangers to peace, and
may God grant you such a sure salvation in Him that you may be
able to say, whenever the day closes, &ldquo;To me to live is
Christ, and to die is gain!&rdquo;</p>

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
